### Pledges

* We are carbon neutral on all our services.
  * Since we are a small company, we will estimate CO2 consumption from our services as well as third partys.
* 1 percent of our revenue will be dedicated to sustainability projects.
* Every year a sustainability report will be created and published.


### Report 2020

Most used service providers already have their own sustainability program to provide services with as little environmental impact as possible. Whenever a provider does not provide any information on this topic, we will estimate an environmental impact and will try to cover that.
